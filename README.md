## Info
Are you tired that each banner or ad linking to amazon is silently injecting their affiliate tracking ID and receive a small revenue of what you bought? And more importantly what you bought?
This extension removes the tracking ID before Chrome is performing the request, ensuring that you are not being tracked.

**Note: This extension won't be released in the Chrome Web Store**

## Features
* Makes an ajax request to the ./git and ./svn URL of the site you are visiting and notifies you when status code is 200.
